# Description
- Below is an illustration of the `anchor-app/.github/pull_request_template.md`
- Normally all commit hashes within a test case execution should remain the same
  - the commit hash is the state of the codebase at the time of test execution
  - This ensures consistency and traceability during testing phase
  - All test cases should be executed against the same codebase state
